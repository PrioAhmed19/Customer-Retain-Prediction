## üß© Methodology

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
- Imported dataset and removed duplicates, missing values, and irrelevant columns  
- Encoded categorical variables with `LabelEncoder`  
- Standardized numerical features using `StandardScaler`

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Visualized churn distribution and behavior trends  
- Relationship analysis between:
  - Age vs Churn  
  - Satisfaction Score vs Churn  
  - Spending Patterns  
  - Support Contact Frequency  

### 3. **Feature Engineering**
- Constructed new interaction-based and ratio features:
  - `Average_Transaction_Amount`
  - `Years_as_Customer`
  - `Num_of_Support_Contacts`

### 4. **Model Training**
Trained and compared:
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- XGBoost  
- LightGBM  
- CatBoost  
- Transformer-based Neural Network (Keras)

### 5. **Hyperparameter Optimization**
Used **Optuna** for automatic search and pruning
